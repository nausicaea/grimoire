# Grimoire

This grimoire contains spells and notes to aid both advanced and aspiring witch
with their daily tasks. First and foremost, it focuses on the domain of
digiturgy.

## Prerequisites

You must have a phantom crucible (e.g. Docker) at your ready.

This grimoire is protected by nine arcane words which you must know before
being able to access the knowledge within. It matters not what the concrete
incarnation of these words is, but you must make them known to the grimoire.

To do this, take a blank sheet, title it `.env` and place it on the same
workbench as the grimoire. The sheet must contain the nine arcane words. An
example follows, for better understanding:

```
SCCACHE_ENDPOINT="<AWS S3 Endpoint>"
SCCACHE_BUCKET="<AWS S3 Bucket Name>"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<AWS S3 Key ID>"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<AWS S3 Secret>"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="<Your PostgreSQL root password>"
RECON_DB_PASSWORD="<The PostgreSQL password for the recon-db account>"
ARCH="x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"
SCCACHE_VERSION="v0.10.0"
SCCACHE_CHECKSUM="sha256:1fbb35e135660d04a2d5e42b59c7874d39b3deb17de56330b25b713ec59f849b"
```
